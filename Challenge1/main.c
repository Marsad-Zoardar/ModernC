 * **********************************The Project: Command History Tracker****************************************************
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Build a program that simulates a simplified command history buffer — like what a shell keeps track of when you press the up-arrow 
 * to see previous commands.
 ***** Core requirements:
 * ->Store a history of commands (strings) the user types, one at a time, in a loop, until they type "exit".

 * ->The history has a starting capacity (say, 5 commands) but must grow dynamically once it fills up — you can't just reject 
 *   new commands once full. When it's full and a new command comes in, resize the storage to hold more (doubling capacity is 
 *   a common, reasonable strategy).
 
 * ->Each stored command must be its own independently allocated string — not a fixed-size char[100] array per slot, but memory
 *   sized to fit whatever the user actually typed (so a 3-character command and a 200-character command shouldn't waste the same 
 *   fixed space).
 
 * ->Track, using a function-persistent counter, the total number of commands ever entered across the program's run — even ones 
 *   that got evicted or overwritten — and print this total when the program exits. (Yes — this is deliberately testing whether 
 *   static inside a function actually stuck with you.)

 * ->Use at least two macros, both genuinely justified by function, not just decorative:
 * --->One for debug/logging output that can be compiled in or out (#ifdef DEBUG style) — think back to why this matters for embedded work.
 
 * --->One that wraps memory allocation with a check — if malloc/realloc ever returns NULL, print an error and exit gracefully rather than 
 *     crashing with a segfault later

 * ->Print the full command history, in order, when the user exits.
 * 
 * ->Free every single allocation before the program ends — every command string, and the array holding them.
 * 
 * ->Run it through valgrind and confirm zero leaks, zero errors — paste me the summary output when you're done, not just "it worked."

 * *******************************Things I'm deliberately NOT teaching you first, that you'll need to research yourself********************
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 * ->How to safely store and grow an array of independently-allocated strings (this means an array of pointers — you'll bump into 
 *   "pointer to pointer" naturally here, which is actually Week 3 material; figuring out how far you can reason about it on your
 *    own first is part of the point)
 * 
 * ->How to duplicate a string into freshly allocated memory of the right size (there's a standard function for this — look it up 
 *   rather than hand-rolling it, but understand what it's doing under the hood once you find it)
 * 
 * ->Exactly how realloc behaves — what happens to your old pointer, what you must do with its return value, and what mistake would 
 *   cause a leak or crash if you handle it carelessly
